# üñ•Ô∏è Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file inside the backend directory:

```plaintext
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

4. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> The backend will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

# üåê Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. (Optional) Configure Axios baseURL inside your services to match the backend URL (`http://localhost:5000`).

4. Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

> The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

# üõ°Ô∏è Architecture Overview

## 1. Authentication Flow:
- User or Admin signs up or logs in.
- Server validates credentials and issues a JWT token.
- JWT token is stored in localStorage on the client-side.
- Each protected API request sends the token in the Authorization header for verification.

## 2. Authorization Flow:
- Middleware verifies the token and extracts user info and role.
- Admin-only routes are protected from normal users.
- Frontend dynamically shows/hides UI components based on user roles (e.g., Admin Dashboard).

## 3. Database Models:

### User Model

| Field    | Type    | Description              |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| name     | String  | User's full name          |
| email    | String  | Unique email address      |
| password | String  | Hashed password           |
| role     | String  | 'user' or 'admin'          |

### BlogPost Model

| Field     | Type     | Description              |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| title     | String   | Title of the blog post     |
| content   | String   | Main content of the blog   |
| author    | ObjectId | References the User model  |
| timestamp | Date     | Post creation time         |
